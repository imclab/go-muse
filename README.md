Golang libraries for reading and processing data from a Muse EEG headset.
Requires the [Muse SDK][1] for muse-io.

**Includes**:

 - Running an OSC server to convert the streams into channels.
 - Adds low-level processing of these channels for things like connection status.
 - Simple UIs for displaying realtime data.
 - ...eventually, more complex signal processing.
